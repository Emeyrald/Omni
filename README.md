# Omni - Personal Voice Assistant
Omni is a Python-based personal voice assistant that responds to spoken commands, performs web searches, manages applications, and keeps logs. Built with speech_recognition, pyttsx3, wolframalpha, and other Python libraries, Omni provides a flexible and extendable voice interface for your computer.

### Features
* Voice-Activated Commands: Use a single activation word (omni) to trigger commands.
* Text-to-Speech: Omni speaks responses and confirmations using pyttsx3.
* Web Navigation: Open websites directly in Chrome via voice.
* Application Management: Open and close apps using voice commands.
* Note Logging: Take voice notes that are automatically saved with timestamps.
* Information Retrieval: Search Wikipedia or WolframAlpha for answers.
* System Commands: Shutdown or restart the computer via voice.

This is a personal project I worked on around 3 years ago, and then updated it to get it working as of 11/4/2025. I always wanted some sort of Jarvis-like AI, so I came up with something that's similar in function, since it can do different tasks for me, but less difficult than making a full blown AI.  

This project is fully in python.
